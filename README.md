# Overview

This is my first Java code. I implemented a GUI to try that and hope to understand more as I continue with this project.

This Software is a cookbook that stores recipes in it. It has a simple GUI that allows you to open windows for multiple recipes at a time.

The purpose of this software is to provide a user a simple interface that allows them to store their recipes. This can also be useful for storing recipes that you find online and allow a simple place to keep them.
